# Lab 3 - PART 2

Extend {Lab3Dir}/main/main.go to use your new functionality

I adjusted the code in main.go to match the changes to host.go
You can now prompt for the next page after a query by pressing 'Y' then 'Enter'. 

How to run:
go build main.go 
SHODAN_API_KEY=CWEJI6WeSzYlMFe9voYi01IWnUNyHazo ./main city:laramie // to 
Y  // to get the next page or any other key to stop the program
